# embedSWF

This project demonstrates how to use the `embedSWF` function to dynamically embed SWF files using the Ruffle Player. It enables embedding an SWF file by providing the file name in the URL's query parameters.
### Key Features
Ruffle Player Integration:

The script uses the Ruffle Player to emulate SWF files in modern web browsers.
### Dynamic File Loading:

The SWF file is dynamically loaded based on the file query parameter from the URL.
### Responsive Player:

The player is styled to take up the full width and height of the container, ensuring a seamless user experience.
### How to Use
Add your files to this repo or fork your own, then use the file with the search param ?file="yourfile.swf"
